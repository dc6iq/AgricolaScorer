Now:	
	- list of all players in database
		- can select from this list
	- can rename players to an existing player
	
	- "in game" note (smaller, grey?) next to "recent players"
	- put game count when displayed on recent players
		- "gameCount" is not actually game count, it's the count of times that player has been selected
	- "checked" gradient is solid colour
	- more rounded corners on buttons
		- Have to define background styles for each of the buttons states.
	- Show graph of final scores vs dates for selected players
	- back-enter old data from old application
	- number picker numbers are a little to low
	- scoring screen is a little dark
		- gradient to a dark brown instead?
		- find space at the edges to margin the black transparency?
	- shrink background a bit in download size
	- use font more to justify 150kb of download!
	
Future:
	- use HoloEverywhere (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10608539/error-importing-holoeverywhere) to reduce API requirement
