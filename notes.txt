Next:
	- delete old games
	- start family members radio on 2
	- can add same player multiple times

	- put game count when displayed on recent players
		- "gameCount" is not actually game count, it's the count of times that player has been selected
	- remove menus for those activities that don't need them
	- "CreateGameActivity" is the main launcher I'm sure it can have a cooler name

Future:
	- exception if history with no history
	- closer look at Database abstraction
	- was somehow able to get 5 players on score screen even with only 3 on tabs
		- there was a back and forth involved.
	- those "titles" appear at the top of the activities, should rename them.
	- Show graph of final scores vs dates for selected players
	- back-enter old data from old application
	- make look good
		- list items to small
		- colours on segmented control
		- background colour
		- more space between segmenteds
		- left margin near number pickers on the left
		- "Recent" isn't "header" enough
