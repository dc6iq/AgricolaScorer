Next:
	- make look good
		- scoring
			- colours on segmented control
			- number picker text needs to be themable
			- number picker buttons need to be the same size
			
	- was somehow able to get 5 players on score screen even with only 3 on tabs
		- there was a back and forth involved.

	- can start game with no players
	- "in game" note (smaller, grey?) next to "recent players"
	- put game count when displayed on recent players
		- "gameCount" is not actually game count, it's the count of times that player has been selected
	- blank screen if no history

Future:
	- more rounded corners on buttons
		- Have to define background styles for each of the buttons states.
	- Show graph of final scores vs dates for selected players
	- back-enter old data from old application
