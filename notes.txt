Next:
	- make look good
		- scoring
			- need to put Finish button somewhere (no menus)
			- list items to small
			- colours on segmented control
	 		- more space between segmenteds
			- left margin near number pickers on the left
		
	- was somehow able to get 5 players on score screen even with only 3 on tabs
		- there was a back and forth involved.

	- can start game with no players
	- "in game" note (smaller, grey?) next to "recent players"
	- put game count when displayed on recent players
		- "gameCount" is not actually game count, it's the count of times that player has been selected
	- blank screen if no history
	- Show graph of final scores vs dates for selected players
	- back-enter old data from old application

Future:
	- more rounded corners on buttons
		- this is a pain. Have to define background styles for each of the buttons states.
