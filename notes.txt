Future:
	- cloud storage of history?
	- add button to expand/collapse all in History
	- edit a game, then hit back until you can select a player, then start game, uses the edited data but doesn't show player on added player list
	- shit goes really bad when you portrait/landscape while scoring
	- put game count when displayed on recent players and player list
		- cursor doesn't contain game count right now, lots of work to make this happen
		- not certain where this should go, since "(in-game)" takes up most of the available comment space
		- put it inside the "(...)"? (in-game, 3 games)?
	- randomization feature (randomize a resource, a farmyard square)
	- use XML plurals for "game count"
	- more rounded corners on buttons
		- Have to define background styles for each of the buttons states.
		- <item name="android:background">@drawable/button</item>
			button.xml		
				<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
				<selector xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
				    <item android:state_window_focused="false" android:state_enabled="true" android:drawable="@drawable/btn_default_normal_holo_light" />
				    <item android:state_window_focused="false" android:state_enabled="false" android:drawable="@drawable/btn_default_disabled_holo_light" />
				    <item android:state_pressed="true" android:drawable="@drawable/btn_default_pressed_holo_light" />
				    <item android:state_focused="true" android:state_enabled="true" android:drawable="@drawable/btn_default_focused_holo_light" />
				    <item android:state_enabled="true" android:drawable="@drawable/btn_default_normal_holo_light" />
				    <item android:state_focused="true" android:drawable="@drawable/btn_default_disabled_focused_holo_light" />
				    <item android:drawable="@drawable/btn_default_disabled_holo_light" />
				</selector>
	- back-enter old data from old application
	- use HoloEverywhere (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10608539/error-importing-holoeverywhere) to reduce API requirement
	- "checked" gradient is solid colour (maybe just accept this...)
	- rename some of the styles, they don't fit anymore
	- pre-populate based on last game? (maybe add an option for it?)
	- make segmented control and number picker use XML for heights and text edit padding
	
	Graph:
		- add graph back in
				- <item android:id="@+id/statistics" android:showAsAction="ifRoom|withText" android:title="@string/statistics" android:icon="@drawable/chart_line"></item>
			    - uncomment code in CreateGameActivity
		- graph colours are pretty bad
		- some weird things if you select odd combinations on the filter screen
		- strange marker placement, likely due to how the Double's are used
			- should probably normalize the dates returned, such that each date is given a number: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
			- then map that number to a particular date for display purposes
			- then either subdivide or interval_by_val of 1, should allow the graph to display properly
		- chart icon is a little brighter than it should be
		- maybe put another title for filter - looks weird when you just click "Ok" and it comes up with a graph
			 (this graph is of "all games with only 2 players"
			 - or maybe you must select players, since the dates would be odd otherwise.
