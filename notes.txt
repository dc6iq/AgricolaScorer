Now:	
	- put game count when displayed on recent players and player list
		- not certain where this should go, since "(in-game)" takes up most of the available comment space
	- "checked" gradient is solid colour
	- more rounded corners on buttons
		- Have to define background styles for each of the buttons states.
	- Show graph of final scores vs dates for selected players
	- back-enter old data from old application
	- number picker numbers are a little to low
	- use font more to justify 150kb of download!
	- start game seems hidden between the other two buttons
	- pre-populate based on last game? (maybe add an option for it?)
	- history list has an arrow in the middle of the date.
	- rename some of the styles, they don't fit anymore
	- remove the "gameCount" column from the database, and stop using it everywhere.
	
Future:
	- use HoloEverywhere (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10608539/error-importing-holoeverywhere) to reduce API requirement
