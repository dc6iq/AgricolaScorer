Future:
	- score for All Creatures
		- what to do about the graph?
			- currently only displays Agricola scores
			- force selection of game type for graph?
		- game count also only counts Agricola, from PlayerMapper
		
	- show/hide all creatures start button
	- maybe make 3 buttons and use "Start %s" -- start_all_creatures_game resource
	- "Start Farmers of the Moor" button?
		- could make FarmersScore to store Farmers only things
	

	- randomization (randomize a resource, a farmyard square)
	- get icons for all of the resources
	- get a farm board photo. Can I draw on top of a drawable in a specific spot?
	- pre-populate based on last game? (maybe add an option for it?)
	- make segmented control and number picker use XML for heights and text edit padding
	- chart icon is a little brighter than it should be
	- set the action bar to have a "back" button on it in some situations.
	- set different colour of checkbox "border"
	- settings first checkbox, when you click it a blue background flashes which is outside of the black border. Put it inside the black border.
	
	Search:
		- error message if you try to search with no players selected
		- optional: Farmers or not
		- search by date defaults: end date is today, start date is start of this month (or something similar)
	
Pipe dream:
	- use HoloEverywhere (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10608539/error-importing-holoeverywhere) to reduce API requirement
	- "checked" gradient is solid colour (maybe just accept this...)
