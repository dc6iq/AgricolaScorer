Now:
	- Show graph of final scores vs dates for selected players
		- http://androidplot.com/
	- put game count when displayed on recent players and player list
		- not certain where this should go, since "(in-game)" takes up most of the available comment space
	- start game seems hidden between the other two buttons

	
Future:
	- more rounded corners on buttons
		- Have to define background styles for each of the buttons states.
		- <item name="android:background">@drawable/button</item>
			button.xml		
				<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
				<selector xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
				    <item android:state_window_focused="false" android:state_enabled="true" android:drawable="@drawable/btn_default_normal_holo_light" />
				    <item android:state_window_focused="false" android:state_enabled="false" android:drawable="@drawable/btn_default_disabled_holo_light" />
				    <item android:state_pressed="true" android:drawable="@drawable/btn_default_pressed_holo_light" />
				    <item android:state_focused="true" android:state_enabled="true" android:drawable="@drawable/btn_default_focused_holo_light" />
				    <item android:state_enabled="true" android:drawable="@drawable/btn_default_normal_holo_light" />
				    <item android:state_focused="true" android:drawable="@drawable/btn_default_disabled_focused_holo_light" />
				    <item android:drawable="@drawable/btn_default_disabled_holo_light" />
				</selector>
	- use font more to justify 150kb of download!
	- back-enter old data from old application
	- use HoloEverywhere (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10608539/error-importing-holoeverywhere) to reduce API requirement
	- "checked" gradient is solid colour
	- rename some of the styles, they don't fit anymore
	- pre-populate based on last game? (maybe add an option for it?)
	- number picker numbers are a little to low in the control

Change Log:
	Major:
		- You can now edit previously saved games! Long-press on a game in History!
		- There is now a list of all players who have played - check the menu in Add Player. You can add a player to your game from this list.
		- Shrunk background by 150kb.
	
	Minor:
		- History now sorted by date
		- Added a "game count" to the main screen
		- You can no longer rename players to an existing player name.
		- Added a note "(in-game)" to player lists to show that a player has been added already.
	
	UI fixes:
		- Added a margin on the score board so it's a little brighter.
		- Lightened the darkest colour in the scoring segmented pickers.
		- Added "+" to fields and pastures maximums.
		- Swapped sides of increment and decrement buttons for number pickers.
		- Fixed the show/hide arrow on the History page
