Future:
	- enter old data from score sheets
	- test on phone
	

	- game count doesn't update right away if you don't close the app and restart it
	- randomization (randomize a resource, a farmyard square)
	- get icons for all of the resources
	- get a farm board photo. Can I draw on top of a drawable in a specific spot?
	- pre-populate players based on last game? (maybe add an option for it?)
	- make segmented control and number picker use XML for heights and text edit padding
	- chart icon is a little brighter than it should be
	- set the action bar to have a "back" button on it in some situations.
	- set different colour of checkbox "border"
	- settings first checkbox, when you click it a blue background flashes which is outside of the black border. Put it inside the black border.
	- a couple places where resources are linked to enums by virtue of positioning, see if this can't be fixed
		- // TODO: relies on order of resources
	- add down arrow back to spinner on SearchStatisticsActivity
	- could make FarmersScore to store Farmers only things
	- Requested: search by date defaults: end date is today, start date is start of this month (or something similar)
	- error message if you try to search with no players selected
	- game type spinner isn't as wide as I would have preferred
		- need to modify the 9-patch files to remove left and right padding

	
Pipe dream:
	- use HoloEverywhere (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10608539/error-importing-holoeverywhere) to reduce API requirement
	- "checked" gradient is solid colour (maybe just accept this...)
